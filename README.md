# restful-react-project

A simple shop API

All the code in this repo is not mine. It is directly the result of what i am learning from this course on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDrU305J1yw

The original code is by # Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller @maxschwarzmueller

The original repo can be found here:

I am very thankful to him for making this repo commonly available. He is a great inspiratrion for me.

In no way I wish to pass this code as my own.
